# Portugese-School-Student-Performance
Developed Machine learning Systems that operate on the given real-world dataset.

# ABSTRACT

In this project an end-to-end Regression based Machine Learning model is built on the Portugese Student Performance Dataset. On whole a totla of three Missions were performed:

MISSION 1: Predict first-period academic performance without any prior academic performance data. <br/>
MISSION 2: Predict final-period academic performance without any prior academic performance data. <br/>
MISSION 3: Predict final academic performance using all available prior academic performance data. <br/>

After loading the data into pandas dataframes, train and test sets are created which are later used for feature selection. We first begin with the visualizations of the features. For this, the Seaborn and MAtplotlib library was used to compute histograms, KDE plots and bar plots to visualize the behaviour of the different features. Additionally, In the case of feature Selection, five different techniques were thoroughly studied using the scikit-learn library.
