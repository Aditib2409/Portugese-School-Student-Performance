# Portugese-School-Student-Performance
Developed Machine learning Systems that operate on the given real-world dataset.

# ABSTRACT

In this project an end-to-end Regression based Machine Learning model is built on the Portugese Student Performance Dataset. On whole a totla of three Missions were performed:

MISSION 1: Predict first-period academic performance without any prior academic performance data. <br/>
MISSION 2: Predict final-period academic performance without any prior academic performance data. <br/>
MISSION 3: Predict final academic performance using all available prior academic performance data. <br/>

Firstly, a detailed Exploratory data analysis is conducted along with Feature selection
A brief, informative description of your project. Include the problem, dataset(s) you used, approach (naming the machine learning methods you used and how you compared them), and key results (be sure to include at least your best result and the method with which you obtained it, for each dataset).
